    "#### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Project 10\n",
    "##### Intensity Analysis (Build your own model using NLP and Python) \n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to develop an intelligent system using NLP to predict the intensity in the text reviews. By analyzing various parameters and process data, the system will predict the intensity where its happiness, angriness or sadness. This predictive capability will enable to proactively optimize their processes, and improve overall customer satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose of the solving this problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of developing an intelligent system using NLP to predict the intensity in text reviews can serve multiple practical applications, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Enhanced Customer Feedback Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding Emotion and Sentiment: Predicting intensity helps companies understand not just whether a review is positive or negative but also the strength of the sentiment. This is useful for prioritizing urgent customer issues (e.g., highly negative reviews) or identifying highly satisfied customers for engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improving Customer Service: By assessing the intensity of reviews, companies can automatically flag highly intense negative reviews for faster resolution, helping to improve customer retention and overall satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Improved Product Development\n",
    "\n",
    "Prioritizing Feedback: Companies can focus on features or products that evoke strong positive or negative reactions. Reviews with higher emotional intensity might signal critical areas to focus on for improvement or enhancement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Product and Service Customization: Understanding how strongly customers feel about certain aspects of a product can guide product customization to align better with customer preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Automated Review Moderation\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifying Harmful or Fake Reviews: Reviews with extreme or unusual levels of intensity might indicate spam, fake, or abusive reviews. The system can help automatically flag these reviews for further investigation or filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Filtering Content: Intensity prediction can aid in automating moderation by detecting emotionally charged or inappropriate content in public forums or review platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4. Market Sentiment and Trend Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Tracking Sentiment Over Time: Predicting intensity can help businesses understand trends in customer sentiment, monitoring changes in customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Competitive Analysis: Companies can analyze the intensity of reviews for their competitorsâ€™ products, gaining insight into how strongly customers react to competitor offerings, which can influence strategic decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5. Mental Health and Well-being Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "Detecting Emotional Distress: In certain applications, such as mental health support platforms, intensity prediction can help detect emotional distress in written feedback or reviews, leading to timely intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Empathy and Interaction: Intelligent systems can be designed to respond with an appropriate tone based on the predicted emotional intensity, enhancing user interaction in support or conversational agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the purpose of solving this problem is to enable deeper insight into the emotional or sentiment-driven aspects of text reviews. This can empower businesses and platforms to enhance customer experience, refine products, manage reputation, and respond more effectively to user feedback.\n",
    "\n",

    "Step 10 : Wait for the file to complete executing the program and then check the output along with the contents in the data, models and visuals directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanations of code and models\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The comments mentioned throughout the notebook already explain the code and the models. However for the purpose of detailed understanding here is the detailed explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A) Loading the dataset, performing Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "##### I) Pandas Cloumn Configuration \n",
    "\n",
    "The code pd.set_option('display.max_colwidth', None) is a pandas configuration setting that changes the way DataFrame columns are displayed in the console or notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "pd.set_option(): This is a function from pandas that allows you to modify certain display options.\n",
    "'display.max_colwidth': This option controls the maximum width (in characters) for the display of each column in a DataFrame when printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "None: Setting it to None means there is no limit on the width. The full content of a column will be displayed, no matter how long the values are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose:\n",
    "By default, pandas truncates the content of cells if it exceeds a certain length, showing an ellipsis (...). By setting max_colwidth to None, you can ensure that the entire content of each cell is displayed without truncation.\n",
    "\n",
